username: Maxime Capuano
user_description: I am a french web developer.
  Most of my experience lies in the back-end side of web development, be it in PHP, C# or Elixir, with some experience with the ReactJS
  framework for the front-end side.
  I also study game engines and interesting computer science subjects, mostly related to programming languages, on my spare time.
